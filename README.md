An area has 5,000 hotspots in a 10x10km area. Each hotspot is at a random location in this area and is never closer than 10m from it's neighbour. Each hotspot broadcasts on one of 5 different channels which is assigned randomly initially. If a hotspot is within 350m of another hotspot and is on the same channel they will interfere. Write a program that will generate the hotspots as described above and change the frequencies such that the number of hotspots that interfere are at a minimum. Produce a plot showing the hotspot locations and the colour of the dot should indicate the channel that the hotspot is on. Hotspots that are being interfered with must have a red border, otherwise they must have a black border.![image](https://github.com/Tami-L/Coding-assesment/assets/106449564/3d63f755-75a8-4164-960b-893cfe6f0a04)
